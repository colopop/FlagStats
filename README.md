# FlagStats
Utility that lets you see how well a you play against different countries on Chess.com.

# Requirements
Python 3, which can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Once you have Python installed, run `pip install PySimpleGUI` and `pip install requests` from the terminal.
Then copy down this repository.

# Running the Program
Go to the folder with chessflags.py in it and open a terminal window there. Type `python chessflags.py`.
In the window that pops up, type your chess.com username and click "Get Stats" (or hit the enter key).
You will see a list of the countries you've played against, along with the total number of games, your win rate, your loss rate, and your draw rate against that country.
To exit the program, click "Done" or close the window.
Your stats may take anywhere from a few moments to a few minutes to calculate, depending on your Internet connection and the number of games you've played.
